## 📖 What is This Wiki?

This repository hosts a **GitHub Wiki**—a feature for sharing detailed, long-form information about a project. Unlike the main repository's code, the Wiki exists as a separate, linked space dedicated entirely to documentation.

This Wiki serves as the **comprehensive, canonical reference** for GitHub's Achievement and profile badge system. It is built and maintained by the community, for the community.

### 🎯 Core Mission
- **Document** every Achievement, badge, and highlight with precise criteria.
- **Educate** users on how to legitimately unlock milestones.
- **Clarify** the differences between Achievements, Highlights, and custom badges.
- **Archive** the history of the system, including retired badges.
- **Foster** a collaborative space for sharing tips and strategies.

## 🏗️ Wiki Architecture & Content Map

The Wiki is structured into logical sections for easy navigation. The diagram below illustrates how the content is organized and how different users might interact with it:

## 🧩 What You'll Find in the Wiki

### 1. **The Master Achievement Index**
The heart of the Wiki. Each Achievement has its own detailed page or a comprehensive table entry, including:
- **Official Name & Emoji**: (e.g., ⭐ Starstruck, 🦈 Pull Shark).
- **Earning Criteria**: Step-by-step, verified instructions. For example, **Pull Shark** is earned by opening pull requests that get merged, while **Galaxy Brain** requires having your replies accepted as answers in Discussions.
- **Tier System**: Many badges have multiple levels (Base, Bronze, Silver, Gold).
- **Visual Examples**: Screenshots of the badge on a profile.
- **Pro Tips & Common Pitfalls**: Community-vetted advice.

### 2. **Guide to Profile "Highlights"**
Clarifies badges that reflect status or program membership, which are distinct from earned Achievements. These include:
- **GitHub Pro**: For active Pro subscribers.
- **Security Bug Bounty Hunter**: For reporting security vulnerabilities.
- **GitHub Campus Expert**: For student leaders in the program.
- **Developer Program Member**.
- **Security Advisory Credit**.

### 3. **Understanding Badges (Shields) in READMEs**
A dedicated section explaining **GitHub Markdown badges**—the customizable status icons you add to your repository's `README.md` file. This is different from profile Achievements but related in spirit. It covers services like **Shields.io** for showing build status, version, or license.

### 4. **The Historical Archive**
Documents badges that are part of GitHub's history but are no longer earnable:
- **Arctic Code Vault Contributor**: For code included in the 2020 archive snapshot.
- **Mars 2020 Helicopter Contributor**: For contributions to the Ingenuity mission repo.

### 5. **Community FAQ & Troubleshooting**
Answers to common questions compiled from official sources and community experience:
- **"Why hasn't my badge appeared?"** (Common reasons: processing delay, private contributions disabled, work done only in a fork).
- **"Can I hide badges?"** (Yes, in profile settings).
- **"Do private contributions count?"** (Yes, if you enable the setting).
